Performs network flow analysis on a network of V points

Each point is a bike station in the citybike network

Pairs of points are connected if they are a distance of _DISTANCE km
from each other. (Ex, .4 km)

Capacity on an edge is the max of the bike docks at each edge vertex.

usage: run NetworkFlowAnalyzer.py "citybike.json" <start-station> <end-station>

Example:
run NetworkFlowAnalyzer.py "citybike.json" "Broadway & Battery Pl" "E 47 St & 1 Ave"

run NetworkFlowAnalyzer.py [-h] [--stations] [--start_station START_STATION] [--end_station END_STATION] filename-json
default start_station: "Broadway & Battery Pl"
default end_station: "E 47 St & 1 Ave"

outputs:
scatter plot of all stations in network
plot of flow network from start to end stations
plot of flow path from start station to end station
plot of edges in st-cut
maximum flow from start to end path
list of edges in flow path with flow/capcity of each edge
list of edges in st-cut
